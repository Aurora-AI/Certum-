# Alpha Neurodesign: Cognitive Architecture for Financial Trust

## Core Philosophy
Neurodesign is the application of neuroscience and psychology to design. For wealth management and high-end financial interfaces, the goal is not just beauty, but **Cognitive Fluency** (ease of processing) and **Trust Engineering**.

## Key Principles

### 1. Hierarchy of Trust (The "Power" Layout)
*   **Principle**: Users scan in F-patterns but linger on "Power Centers".
*   **Application**:
    *   **Headline**: Must be short, declarative, and serif (Tiempos Headline or similar).
    *   **Whitespace**: Luxury is defined by the *absence* of clutter. Use 2x more whitespace than functional apps.
    *   **Golden Ratio**: Use strict grid alignment (12-column).

### 2. Cognitive Load Reduction
*   **Hick's Law**: The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
*   **Action**: Never present more than 3 primary actions.
    *   *Bad*: "Contact Us", "Learn More", "Download App", "Login", "Blog".
    *   *Good*: "Join the Consortium" (Primary), "Our Thesis" (Secondary).

### 3. The "Sovereign" Aesthetic
*   **Color Psychology**:
    *   *Deep Navy/Black*: Authority, Stability.
    *   *Gold/Bronze*: Wealth, Exclusivity.
    *   *Off-White/Cream*: Sophistication (vs. sterile clinical white).
*   **Texture**: Use subtle noise or grain to prevent "digital sterility".

### 4. Typography as Interface
*   **Serif for Trust**: Serifs (Times, Garamond derivatives) imply history and institution.
*   **Sans for Utility**: Grotesque Sans (Inter, Helvetica) for data and controls.
*   **Rule**: Never use Sans for the primary emotional message.

## Actionable Prompts for Layout Generation
*   "Create a layout that feels like a private bank vault: secure, heavy, and silent."
*   "Use negative space to force the user's eye to the singular value proposition."
*   "Avoid 'marketing' fluff. Speak in axioms."
