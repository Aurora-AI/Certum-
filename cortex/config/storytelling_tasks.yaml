    Review the 'Ademicon Methodology' and the 'Living Website' concept.
    Dream of a website Narrative where the User is the 'Architect of their Future'.
    The site shouldn't just show products; it should 'sense' the user's financial anxiety or ambition.
    Output a Creative Manifesto: "The Living Vault of Wealth".
  expected_output: "A passionate, emotional narrative document describing the user's journey from Chaos to Order via Consortium."

    Take the 'Creative Manifesto' and map it to the Aurora Tech Stack (Next.js, Cortex, CrewAI).
    Define the 'Living Pages':
    1. Hero (already done).
    2. The 'Vault' (Product Grid).
    3. The 'Architect' (Chat/Consultant).
    Explain how the 'NeuroSensor' will work in each section.
  expected_output: "A Technical blueprint (Site Map & Sensor Logic) implementing the Dream."

    Review the Manifesto and the Blueprint against the 'Ademicon Methodology'.
    Critique: Does this enforce S.R.V.? Does this empower the 'Ademilover'?
    Is it too 'Retail' (Insurance-like) or truly 'High-Ticket' (Wealth)?
    Refine the plan to ensure maximum Conversion Power.
  expected_output: "An Approved Strategic Roadmap for the Website Construction, validated by Ademicon Logic."
