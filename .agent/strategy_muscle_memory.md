# Strategic Brief: Muscle Memory Interface
**Study Source**: `visual_consortium_strategy.md`, `cognitive_positioning.md`

## The Problem
"Architecture of Wealth" is too abstract. It fails the **50ms Test**. Users need immediate cognitive fluency ("Muscle Memory") to know what is being sold.

## The Solution: The Trinity of Sovereign Wealth
We will ground the abstract visuals in 3 direct, market-standard pillars, aligned with the video scenes.

### 1. The Pre-Load Sequence (New Request)
**Concept**: "The Download". Before the system starts, we install the 3 core modules in the user's mind.
**Sequence**:
1.  **Logo** (Pulse)
2.  **CONSÓRCIO** (Solid, Concrete)
3.  **SEGUROS** (Warm, Protected)
4.  **WEALTH** (Fluid, Infinite)
5.  *Reveal Hero*

### 2. Hero Video Mapping (Overlays)
We will update the Remotion video to display the **PRODUCT NAME** instead of the abstract "Emotion".

| Scene | Old Text | **New Muscle Memory Text** | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Garage** (Car) | Silêncio | **CONSÓRCIO** | The Asset. The Acquisition. (High Ticket) |
| **Watch** (Gears) | Precisão | **WEALTH** | Time as currency. Precision management. |
| **Family** (Legacy) | Legado | **SEGUROS** | Protection of what matters. Perpetuation. |
| **Math** (Flow) | Entropia | **ESTRATÉGIA** | The logic behind the growth. |

*(Note: Ordering in video: Garage -> Watch -> Math -> Family)*

### 3. Hero UI (Direct Action)
Replace "Prompt Chips" (Chat metaphor) with "Direct Access" (muscle memory).

- *Chip 1*: "Projetar Cofre" -> **Simular Consórcio** (Action: Build)
- *Chip 2*: "Analisar Entropia" -> **Cotar Seguro** (Action: Protect)
- *Chip 3*: "Iniciar Protocolo" -> **Falar com Banker** (Action: Connect)

## Execution Plan
1.  **Refine Video**: Update `HeroSequence.tsx` texts.
2.  **Refine UI**: Update `HeroSection.tsx` chips.
3.  **Implement Pre-loader**: Check/Activate `GenesisPreloader` with the Word Cycle.
