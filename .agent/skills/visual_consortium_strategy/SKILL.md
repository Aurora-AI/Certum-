# Visual Consortium Strategy (Brazil Focus)

## 1. The Core Conflict: Anxiety vs. Aspiration
- **Insurance:** Sells "Peace of Mind" (Loss Aversion).
    - *Visual Rule:* Show **Continuity**. Not the accident, but the life continuing smoothly *after* the invisible resolution.
    - *Lighting:* Warm, enveloping. "Golden Hour".
- **Consortium:** Sells "Aspiration" (Dopamine/Reward).
    - *Visual Rule:* Show **Tangible Progress**. Not a "Piggy Bank" (infantilizing), but growing structures (roots, foundations) or the POV of enjoyment.
    - *Metaphor:* "The Tunnel to Light". Visuals should lead the eye to a destination.

## 2. Decoding Brazilian Class A/B Aspirations (2025)
### The Home (Consortium Imobiliário)
- **OLD Code (Avoid):** Ostentatious facades, generic mansions, empty "showrooms".
- **NEW Code (Adopt):** **Integration with Nature**. Open concepts, bringing the green in. The luxury is *peace* and *privacy*.
- **The Shot:** **First-Person POV**. A hand holding a coffee cup looking at a garden. Let the user *embody* the ownership.

### The Vehicle (Consortium Auto)
- **OLD Code:** Static car in showroom.
- **NEW Code:** **The Capsule of Experience**. The car as a means to freedom (travel, beach, mountains).
- **Tech Luxury:** Silence, electric dashboards, illuminated interiors.

### The Family (The "Why")
- **Rule:** **No "Margarina Families"**. Authenticity is key.
- **Diversity:** Real Brazilian diversity (Black, Pardo, Asian-Brazilian).
- **Context:** Commensality (eating together). Tables full of food = Abundance/Safety.

## 3. Neuro-Aesthetic Technical Rules
- **Anti-AI Crafting:** Users detect "Plastic AI" instantly. Use **High-Texture** imagery (pores, wood grain, concrete rugosity) to signal Truth.
- **Bento Grids:** Break complex info (Lance, Taxas) into modular cells.
- **Cinemagraphs:** Use subtle motion (wind, light reflection) instead of heavy video. Low cognitive load, high emotional retention.
- **Color Palette 2026:**
    - **Wealthy Greens:** Growth/Stability (Consortium).
    - **Warm Sands:** Grounding/Trust (Insurance).
    - **Midnight Blue:** Authority (Data/Dashboards).
    - **Coral/Orange:** Action (CTA Only).

## 4. Regulatory Guardrails (CONAR/CDC)
- **No False Promises:** Never show "money falling from sky". Show the *asset*, not speculation.
- **No Fear Mongering:** Crying people, burnt houses, hospital beds are forbidden. Use "The Empty Chair" or subtler metaphors for loss.
