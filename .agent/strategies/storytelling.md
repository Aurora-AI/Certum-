# The Living Vault of Wealth
> *Validation Status:* Generated by Storytelling Crew (Dreamer Phase). Awaiting Critic Refinement.

## The Narrative Arc: From Chaos to Order

You begin in **Chaos**. The internet is noise. Banks are cold numbers. Inflation is a silent killer. You feel the entropy eroding your future.
You seek **Order**. But not the dead order of a spreadsheet. You seek the living order of a forest, of a coral reef. Resilient. Antifragile.

### Act I: The Encounter (The Hero Section)
You arrive at Aurora. It is not a landing page. It is a mirror.
- **The Sensor:** It feels your hesitation. If you stop, it breathes. If you move fast, it sharpens.
- **The Promise:** "You are not buying credit. You are architecting legacy."
- **The Mechanism:** The S.R.V. logic is hidden behind beauty. The "Dream" (Sonho) is the visual hook.
- **The Language:** "Sovereign English" creates authority, but **"Scramble Translation"** ensures understanding. Terms like *Wealth Management* scramble into *Gestão de Fortuna* after 0.5s.

### Act II: The Confluence (The Product Grid)
You enter the Vault. It is not a list of products. It is a **Wealthscape**.
- **Visuals (Hybrid Rule):** We use **Abstract + Concrete** anchors.
    *   **The Oak (Imóveis):** A glowing majestic oak, but with a **Modernist House** nestled in its roots.
    *   **The River (Veículos/Frota):** A stream of light, but with a **Phantom Car** silhouette drifting along it.
    *   *Reason:* No muscle memory for pure abstraction. The user must recognize the product instantly.
- **Investment Logic:**
    *   **The Wind (Serviços):** Ethereal. Experiences.
- **The Neuro-Feedback:** When you hover over a "High Velocity" group (Lance Alto), the interface accelerates (particles move faster). When you hover over a "Long Term" group, it slows down via Lenis (Time Dilation).

### Act III: The Architect (The Consultation)
You do not fill a form. You converse with the **Architect** (Cortex Agents).
- **The Dialogue:**
    *   *Agent:* "I sense ambition. You want high liquidity?" (Detecting fast mouse movement).
    *   *User:* "Yes."
    *   *Agent:* "Then we build with Velocity. Let's analyze your assets for a Lance." (Ademicon V-Phase).
- **The Outcome:** A "Blueprint" is generated. Not a PDF quote, but a 3D visualization of your future equity curve.

## Technical Blueprint (The Realist's Map)

### 1. The Sensor Array (`useNeuroSensor`)
- **Hesitation Index:** Measures doubt (dwell time). Triggers "Reassurance" animations (Pulse).
- **Ambition Index:** Measures speed/directness. Triggers "Opportunity" highlights (Sharpen).

### 2. The Living Pages (Next.js 15)
- **Home:** The Mirror. Reacts to anxiety/calm.
- **The Vault:** 3D R3F Scene. Products as physical objects.
- **The Bridge:** API Route to Cortex (`storytelling_crew`).

### 3. The Ademicon Guardrails (The Critic)
- **Never sell Debt.** Sell Leverage.
- **Always quantify Reality.** If the sensors detect "financial stress" (anxious interaction), the Architect suggests "Lite Groups" (Lower barrier).
- **The Most Expensive Hour.** Don't waste time on "windows shoppers". If engagement is low, the site "closes up" (becomes minimalist) to filter the lead.
