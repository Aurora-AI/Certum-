- **Context:** Cognitive Architecture for WealthTech

## 1. The 50ms Trust Test
Trust is heuristic, not algorithmic.

- **Trigger:** The amygdala evaluates safety in < 50ms based on visual order and complexity.
- **Requirement:** Visuals must be "quiet". High signal-to-noise ratio. Eliminate cognitive friction.
- **Consequence:** If the interface fails the 50ms test, no amount of logic will recover the user's trust.

## 2. Semiotics of Power
- **Rugged Luxury:** For heavy assets (machinery), evok power and durability. Not "utility", but "competence".
- **Sanctuary:** For real estate/wealth, evoke safety and unshakeable stability. The UI is a vault.

---

## 3. Neuro-Symbolic Necessity
Generative AI alone is insufficient for high-stakes wealth management.

- **Deterministic AI:** Outputs must be chemically verifiable. Input A > Output B always.
- **Symbolic Logic:** Use LLMs for intent parsing, but Math Engines for calculation.
- **Audit Trails:** Every suggestion must have a "Citation Layer".

## 4. Local-First Sovereignty
- **Data Residence:** User data lives on the user's device first. Cloud is for backup/sync only.
- **Encryption:** Client-side keys. Zero-Trust architecture.
